/**
 * Run the guided first-run flow against a throwaway install.
 *
 *   npm run dev:fresh             (from apps/desktop)
 *   npm run dev:mock              the same flow, scripted — no model, no venv
 *   ... -- --new                  ...as if this machine were unboxed today
 *   ... -- --spark                ...as if it were an RTX Spark, unboxed today
 *
 * Onboarding happens once per install and writes as it goes — profiles
 * (`hermes-setup`, then the task bot), Electron latches, connection state. So
 * testing it needs a sandbox, and it needs all three of these or it silently
 * does the wrong thing:
 *
 *   HOME                          profiles are HOME-anchored by design
 *                                 (`_get_profiles_root`), so this is what keeps
 *                                 minted bots out of your real ~/.hermes
 *   HERMES_HOME                   must be explicit — the user-data override
 *                                 alone relocates it to an EMPTY dir, and an
 *                                 empty home means the first-run installer
 *                                 instead of the flow (looks like a hang)
 *   HERMES_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR  Electron ignores HOME for userData on macOS,
 *                                 so without it the onboarding latches in your
 *                                 real profile suppress the whole thing
 *
 * Credentials are copied from your real ~/.hermes: the flow needs a working
 * model, not a working install.
 *
 * The sandbox is wiped every run — a second run of a once-per-install flow
 * tests nothing. Pass --keep to resume one (e.g. to inspect what it wrote).
 *
 * --mock replaces the backend with scripts/mock-gateway: the same flow, every
 * turn scripted, in milliseconds. Use it for UI iteration and demo rehearsal,
 * where waiting on a real model between every card is the whole cost; use the
 * default when what you are testing is the model actually driving the flow.
