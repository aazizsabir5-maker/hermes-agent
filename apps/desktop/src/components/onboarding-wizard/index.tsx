/**
 * OnboardingWizardGate — orchestrates the Dia-style setup wizard.
 *
 * In Electron the wizard lives in its OWN OS window (`?win=onboarding`) and
 * the main app window stays hidden until it finishes — setup must never read
 * as an overlay on the app. This gate only coordinates: it asks main to open
 * the window when the store goes active, and commits the outcome when the
 * window reports back. In a plain browser (dev/screenshot loop) there is no
 * bridge, so the surface renders inline as a fallback.
 *
 * Entry paths:
 * - Normal: the intro cinematic's `finishIntroReveal()` starts the wizard.
 * - Resume: app restarted mid-wizard (intro seen, wizard not done) — this gate
 *   restarts it once the gateway is up.
 *
 * On completion the gate commits the answers that outlive the wizard (theme
 * sync + layout preset), then hands off to the first-chat kickoff (hidden
 * seeded turn; Hermes greets first). If the run still needs a provider (mint
 * failed and the user skipped the provider step), the kickoff is skipped —
 * there is nothing to greet with.
