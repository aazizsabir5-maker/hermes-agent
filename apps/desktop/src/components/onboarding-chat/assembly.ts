/**
 * The "magic lego" assembly for in-chat onboarding.
 *
 * The guided chat starts SOLO: just the chat pane in a small window — no
 * sidebar, no statusbar, nothing to explain. When the user picks a layout in
 * the ::onboarding card, the app assembles around the conversation:
 *
 * 1. The OS window grows OUTWARD by the MINIMUM each layout needs — the
 *    sidebar's width to the left, the terminal/rail minimums where a layout
 *    has them — animated (macOS setBounds animate), so the chat stays roughly
 *    where it was and the window ends as small as the layout allows.
 * 2. The new panes mount into the grown area with a staggered snap-in
 *    animation (`pane-lego-in`).
 * 3. The statusbar comes back; its height is pre-added to the bottom growth
 *    so its arrival doesn't lift the composer.
