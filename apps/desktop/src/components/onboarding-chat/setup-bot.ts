/**
 * Setup bot — the bot-mode variant of the guided onboarding.
 *
 * The guided chat is no longer an anonymous session: it is the canonical
 * "Bot Chat" of a persistent `hermes-setup` profile ("Setup" in the Bots
 * roster). Setup walks the user through the same beats as before, but when
 * the first task is decided it does NOT build it here — it emits
 * `::onboarding{step="handoff" task="…" brief="…"}` and the renderer mints a
 * NEW bot around that task, opens the new bot's chat, and starts the build
 * there. Setup stays alive: it gets a hidden [setup] note about the handoff,
 * schedules its own check-ins (cronjob tool), and remains one roster click
 * away — training wheels the user can ignore or retire whenever.
 *
 * This module owns the pure pieces (names, souls, seed prompts, the handoff
 * request atom). The side effects — profiles.create, session.create, the
 * chat switch — live in the wiring's handoff effect so they run with real
 * gateway/session hooks.
